It's a chatting app as of now it doesn't have multiple users you can pretty much only message me (MY ID ON GLOBECONNECT = "Corpse_Inonix"). I was looking for people to
try out my new application as this is the most complicated one I have built so far, so if you stumbled across this repository then send me a message on GlobeConnect so
I can check if it functions properly :)

There is a .jar file included in the repository but it doesn't function properly if you mess with the folder that is already provided in the repository if you are
interested in the full product then here's a link to the actual file : "https://www.mediafire.com/file/br0jzixu1rvinay/Globe_Connect.zip/file"
